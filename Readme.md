# Project: TD Methods to traverse the Cliff Walking Env

In this project we will implement multiple TD techniques:
TD Prediction
TD Control : SARSA
Q-Learning
TD Control: Expected SARSA

to traverse through the CliffWalking environment, a 4x12 gridworld environment.

Note: The algorithms are designed to work with any OpenAI Gym environment.
